## Installation

The main purpose of this project is to provide the deliverables and the R code needed to generate the deliverables.

You will need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and use your preferred IDE (e.g. RStudio is a popular choice) to run the code.

Additionally, when running the code, change the local filepath of the code to where the datasets are stored on your device/ connection. A copy of the original data is stored in our [`Data/Original`](https://github.gatech.edu/MGT-6203-Fall-2022-Canvas/Team-68/tree/main/Data/Original) folder. When running the model code, import the cleaned data for the [`Data/Cleaned`](https://github.gatech.edu/MGT-6203-Fall-2022-Canvas/Team-68/tree/main/Data/Cleaned) folder.

## Directory Structure

Directory should be self explanatory. 

Key Folders include: [Final Code](https://github.gatech.edu/MGT-6203-Fall-2022-Canvas/Team-68/tree/main/Final%20Code) (where the final code is stored), and [Final Report](https://github.gatech.edu/MGT-6203-Fall-2022-Canvas/Team-68/tree/main/Final%20Report) (where the final Report is stored)

Inside the Final Code Folder, the work done and the relevant code has been split into:
1. Data Cleaning and EDA (`Data_Cleaning_and_EDA`),
2. Initial Log Regression Model (`Initial_LogReg_model`), 
3. Final Model Script (`Final_Model_Script`), and
4. Miscellaneous (`Miscellaneous`)
           
## Project Overview, Purpose and Goal

The problem we set out to investigate was: _What health factors may correlate and predict an elevated level of blood pressure in American society?_

The approach we used was: _Using data provided by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, our intent is to analyze various factors association with blood pressure, including: Demographics, Diet, Lab Test Info, Medications, and Doctorâ€™s Exam Answers._

And we had the goal to understand our hypothesis: _Patients in our dataset that are identified to be obese & have a high sodium intake will also have hypertension_
